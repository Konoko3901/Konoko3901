### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My call sign is Konoko.  
I am currently working on making my own stick controls for PC gaming.
This is my first time using github in order to create and communicate
I have seen other open stick projects online, and on github, and it's great work, but I find the documentation limited.
The goal is not only to create sticks and throttles but to document and communicate to others how to follow along and possibly even improve upon
I am aiming to provide weekly updates, even if the update is "No change of progress" as I have other priorities that may take most if not all of my time.
